## Overview

Welcome to myAudiofiler, our group project for [SOFTWARE ENGINEERING 01:198:431](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/academics/undergraduate/course-synopses/course-details/01-198-431-software-engineering) @ Rutgers University

This cloub-based web app is a personalized music management solution for record collectors/audiophiles. 

We are deploying our app using Render. Preview it [HERE](https://myaudiofiler.onrender.com/)  

**NOTE:** This is a limited preview as our app is still undergoing development and testing. We have plans to implement more functionality than initially intended.
